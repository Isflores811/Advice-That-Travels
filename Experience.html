          <h2>United States</h2>
          <p>Embarking on my very first big boy trip was an exhilarating adventure that ignited my passion for cross country travel. Little did I know that this initial escapade would become a thrilling trilogy, leaving me yearning for more. Across a span of three epic voyages, I conquered over 30,000 miles of open road, weaving through the tapestry of our vast nation and indulging in the wonders of over 40+ states.
            With a combined expenditure of $2,000/person on two three-week expeditions and $2,500/person on a month-long odyssey, our adventures were priceless in every sense. We wholeheartedly embraced the mantra of "collecting memories, not things," and the return on investment was immeasurable.
            My cross country escapades were more than just trips; they were transformative experiences that infused my life with a need to travel. If you're yearning for an epic adventure, where cherished memories are made and bonds are strengthened, look no further than a cross country expedition. The open road awaits, ready to be conquered by your spirit of adventure.

          <h2>Europe</h2>
          <p>My craziest trip to date and by far the most life Changing one was my trip across the pound to Europe. To this day, the overwhelming sense of joy and gratitude for the opportunity to embark on such an adventure remains vivid in my memory. The mission all though simple now but at first daunting - 2 people, one car, $7,000/person, and 2 months to roam around the continent.
            Driving through picturesque landscapes and captivating regions, we reveled in the ability to witness firsthand the stunning sights each country had to offer. From the exhilarating spectacle of running with the bulls to the awe-inspiring fjords of Norway to the idyllic beaches of Crete, we reveled in the diverse tapestry of landscapes that unfolded before our eyes.
            This travel experience had a profound impact on my perspective, impacting me in more ways than I could have imagined. I don't know where live will take me as I get older, but one thing is for certin - I had developed an unwavering desire to embrace the world and all it had to offer.

          <h2>Iceland</h2>
          <p>My trip to Iceland was a spontaneous one that was spurred on by how cheap plane tickets were at the time. With the knowledge that an 8-day trip would be good enough to fully experience the wonders of this captivating island nation, the decision was an easy one in the end. Fortunate circumstances aligned, and our budget was perfectly suited for what kind of trip me and my friend wanted to take, making the endeavor all the more enticing.
            Pricing in at $1000/person didn't make the trip any less exciting because of how cheap it was, it just made it a perfect adventure that didn't break the bank. Over the course of the trip, we traveled around Iceland, navigating the diverse landscapes by car. Choosing to go in May was also a very smart decision because the hiking was prime and the sun only went down for about 2 hours due to the midnight sun. Ever go hiking at 2am while the sun is up? If not you got to try it!
            Our chosen "hotels" provided us with the comfort of a private room while offering shared kitchen and bathroom facilities, allowing us to interact with fellow travelers and experience the vibrant travel community that Iceland fosters.
            All in all, this impromptu journey to Iceland left an indelible mark on me. The seamless combination of a limited timeframe, a reasonable budget, and the magnificent landscapes made this experience all the more special. After the trip I truly believed that even though budgets may be thin, it doesn't make trips less exciting!

          <h2>Puerto Rico</h2>
          <p>Throughout my life, I have been fortunate enough to visit Puerto Rico multiple times with my family, thanks to my mother's native roots on the island. However, one summer I had the opportunity to venture back to my island roots with a close friend.
            It was an experience that added a refreshing twist to my familiar Puerto Rican escapades.
            What made this trip even more special was the fact that I had relatives on the island who graciously offered me and my friend a place to stay. So not only was I able to visit with family, but also allowed us to allocate more of our budget towards thrilling adventures and exploration. From beaches, to rainforest, to caves and a chain of archipelago islands. This trip hit almost everything!
            By exploring the island beyond the typical tourist spots, we were able to experience a different type of island adventure.
